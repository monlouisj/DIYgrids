# DIYgrids
A guide to design your own AngularJS grids with filters and sorting. Because it's not that hard!

I needed to display different data sets (that means different datas AND different columns) inside grids and switch between them.

I tried *ng-grid*/*ui-grid*, *trNgTable*, *angular-google-chart* and none could meet my needs. The problem is that they do not handle reloading a different data set without breaking the ui.

So, DIYgrids allows you to do just that using AngularJS and Bootstrap.
